### Introduction
Guessing Game is a project I continously build upon to practice the new technology that I learn. I had knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript but never used them all together to create a single application until now. As I continue to learn web development I will implement my lessons in this project.
### Technologies
Bootstrap 5.2.2
### Setup
This web application is live [here](https://nicholasbear97.github.io/number-game/)
### Status
Guessing Game is currently under development.
Changes to Currently Commit:
1. Create better user experience by adding more logic to filter different answer pathways. Fix grammar for single guesses vs multiple guesses.
2. Add more design to game for less blandness.
3. Create better landing page, prompt user for higher number AFTER page has loaded and not using the prompt() function.

In the Future: New technologies like React, Node, and MongoDB will be added to improve the game and code. Currently, I am researching ways to improve user experience and write cleaner code through React. Afterwards, my plan is to create a database of players and their high (or low) scores in a standardized game. The players with the least amount of guesses in a given interval will be at the top of the scoreboard. This database will be managed using MongoDB and connected to the game using Node.js. As I research which technologies are efficient for certain tasks, my decision to use them may change.

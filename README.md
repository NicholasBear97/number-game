### Introduction
Guessing Game is a project I continously build upon to practice the new technology that I learn. I had knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript but never used them all together to create a single application until now. As I continue to learn web development I will implement my lessons in this project.
### Technologies
Bootstrap 5.2.2
### Setup
This web application is live at <https://nicholasbear97.github.io/guessing-game/>
### Status
Guessing Game is currently under development. New technologies like React, Node, and MongoDB will be added to improve the game and code. Currently, I am researching ways to improve user experience and write cleaner code through React. Afterwards, my plan is to create a database of players and their high (or low) scores in a standardized game. The players with the least amount of guesses in a given interval will be at the top of the scoreboard. This database will be managed using MongoDB and connected to the game using Node.js. As I research which technologies are efficient for certain tasks, my decision to use them may change.
